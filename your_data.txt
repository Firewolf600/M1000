Put ur custom data here
my data was in the .pdf format , what i tried the rag with was a physics text book ,
the data can be of any data type , just remember to let ur code exract the words so that it can be converted to
chunks and then stored into the vector db.
so yes this can be a database or a wordfile or anything u like just improvise accordingly
